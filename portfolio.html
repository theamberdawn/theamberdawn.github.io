                <p><b>Summary</b><br>
                    Beer Buddy was my first time designing as a part of a team. With the freedom to create any app we
                    wanted,
                    my team decided to create an app for our beer loving friends who are always looking for a new drink
                    but need help finding new options,
                    as the craft beer industry grows. We were able to create a beer companion app that allowed users to
                    save and search for new beers that would suit their individual tastes.<br>
