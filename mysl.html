                            <h1 style="text-align:center">Muslim Youth Soccer Team</h1>
                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>MYSL is a soccer league whose current website is poorly designed. For this project, we brought the site into 2020. <br>
                                The Muslim Youth Soccer League wants to bring families together through sports, while promising to keep kids in a safe environment. <br>
                                Their current site serves only as an informational site, but the league owner would prefer it if his site was able to handle new signups as well. 
                                In addition to that, he would like it to also function as a portal for members of the league to stay connected. <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Research & Empathy</h2>
                            <p>Because the site would be used by many different kinds of users, our group decided that the user interviews should include all potential kinds of users - 
                                family of potential new players as well as the staff. Thus, there were two different interview sets conducted by different members of the group. 
                                We also created a survey that would lead to different sets of questions, depending on how the first question was answered.<br>
                                When conducting a heuristic evaluation we noted that the site lacked even basic functions, as information was not always clear or present.<br>                                
                            </p>

                            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                            <p>Talking to the owner of the site, he noted that his main issue with the site is that it currently doesnâ€™t have any function apart from providing potential players with information.<br>
                                Because the league is specifically for youth, many interviewees noted that safety would be a major concern for them.<br>                                
                            </p>

                            <h2>Ideation & Prototype</h2>
                            <p>To look for inspiration for the new site, we decided to look at both local sports teams sites, along with the major leagues, to see what jumped out at us. 
                                We noted that the sites created a feelling of energy and excitement <br>    
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Testing & Reiteration</h2>
                            <p>From our user testing we noted that some of the fonts that we picked for the site, although fitting with the theme, was not easy to read for all of our users.<br> </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>By making sure to empathize with all parties that would be utilizing the site, MYSL will be able to have a site that will be able to both create and retain players to build a stronger community.<br> 
                            </p>
