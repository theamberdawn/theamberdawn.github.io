                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Expedia is a leader in vacation bookings, but faces considerable competition. For this project, I designed a new opening interaction for the app.<br>
                                Through the University of Toronto’s UX/UI course, students were tasked with researching the current vacation app market. 
                                Through user interviews and testing, the root cause of traveller’s anxiety was determined and solutions created. 
                                We were given about one week to complete this task. It had a scope of about 15 people, 5 in-person interviews and 10 surveys received, a group of 30 year old office workers.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Research & Empathy</h2>
                            <p>For this assignment, I started by determining who would define my proto persona. 
                                Due to the scope of the project, I decided to keep the research to people in my own age group, given the time constraints and impact of the global pandemic. 
                                The result was a proto persona of a young working woman who would be seeking a vacation for herself, plus a partner or friends. 
                                Interviews were done in person with a script that emulated a casual conversation. I also sent out a survey that encompassed the essence of the in person interviews, but altered to fit survey format.<br>
                                I also researched the market for this assignment. I started by first going to Expedia’s own site and app to perform a heuristic evaluation on its current appearance. 
                                I noted that Expedia used strong branding with its logo colours and focus on getting the user excited about the possibilities of their vacation. 
                                Following this, I took a look at competitors, as one of the interviewees mentioned a specific site that they like to use when booking travel. 
                                I performed the same heuristic evaluation of competitors sites and apps to determine strengths and weaknesses in contrast to Expedia’s own.<br>
                                User interviews were also conducted, in addition to a survey. The interviews were conducted in an informal style, 
                                as I wanted to ensure that the participants were at ease which I believe yielded more honest answers. 
                                A common theme I noted from all of the interviews was the participant’s anxiety over traveling. There are a number of factors that must be considered and coordinated, along with personal safety.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                            <p>The responses from my interviews and surveys yielded a diverse number of opinions, but I knew that it needed to be condensed into more concise language. 
                                Using an affinity diagram, I was able to break down my conversations into smaller points. I organized and grouped similar ideas to see the main user insights. 
                                Key insights discovered included anxiety caused by the planning and travelling aspects of a vacation. Many wished for a service that would book all aspects of a vacation from start to finish. 
                                Next a feature prioritization matrix was used to determine the cost to implement and benefit of each idea. 
                                From this exercise it was noted which ideas would be potential changes and/or new features to be addressed in the redesign. 
                                One of the features that stood out as an item that would have a high impact on customers was the ability to book as many services in one place as possible.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Ideation & Prototype</h2>
                            <p>Taking into consideration the insights that I gained from my research, I started on ideating features that would address the user’s concerns. 
                                I created a storyboard to plan out a user’s journey using Expedia. I actually worked backwards, creating the last panel first, with the user happy on their vacation. 
                                I then worked on the steps to get the user to that goal. From this decided that the key feature that would be implemented was the ability to book as many services as possible when logging into the app for the user. 
                                I also wanted to make the onboarding process as seamless as possible, as it was another point of contention that came out from my interviews.<br>
                                I designed the new opening interaction using Expedia’s current themes and colours. Using Adobe XD, I started by creating wireframes to simply decide on where exactly I wanted the placement of each element. 
                                Once finished, I conducted user tests to make sure that the interactions were intuitive.<br>
                                Once I collected sufficient feedback on the wireframes, I set to work on the prototype. I started by incorporating Expedia’s current colour story into the wireframe. 
                                Because it is known by Expedia’s current customer base, I believed it would be best to keep it. 
                                From there I went on to incorporate the new features into the app, the new onboarding flow and the new interaction for browsing vacation deals. <br>    
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Testing & Reiteration</h2>
                            <p>After completing the higher fidelity prototypes I set out to test them to make sure that the new interaction translated from inception to execution.<br> </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In conclusion, I found the process to be very intriguing, more so with the threat of Covid. 
                                Due to the overall stress of going on vacation, any all in one solutions that can be created could greatly benefit the customer.<br> 
                            </p>
