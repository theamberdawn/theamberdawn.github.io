                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Beer Buddy is a companion app, designed for helping beer lovers find craft beer. <br>
                                For this project, students were grouped together to create an app of their choice. 
                                Our group chose to create an app that would allow fans of craft beer to search and save their favourite beers. We were given about a week and a half to complete this assignment. <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Research & Empathy</h2>
                            <p>Our team started by first creating a proto persona. As we all had friends who enjoyed craft beer, we used them to create a persona that was a mix of all of them. 
                                Our proto persona was a young male who worked as a programmer in Toronto and enjoys drinking with friends, but also enjoys beer on his own in his down time.<br>
                                Using this proto persona, we created our research plan. We decided that asking our friends who enjoy craft beer would provide valuable feedback, 
                                so they were the main target of our interviews. Because we also wanted some additional info, we also created a survey to send out to as many people as possible.<br>                                
                            </p>

                            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                            <p>Our team individually interviewed our friends to find out what they would like to see from a craft beer app. 
                                The interviews revealed that our assumption in our proto persona was true: different people drink under different circumstances, 
                                and so we realized that our app would need to provide solutions that would not alienate different users’ preferences.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Ideation & Prototype</h2>
                            <p>From conducting interviews, we learned that the craft beer community is a very diverse one. Thus, we wanted to focus on making an app that could be used by almost anyone. 
                                A consistent point that we heard from interviews was that the craft beer industry is growing and it becomes hard to keep track of what is new. 
                                Additionally, many noted that because they are drinking, they tend to forget what they have already tried if they don’t keep the can or bottle. 
                                Users also noted that it can be hard to locate certain kinds of craft beer, depending on how big the brewery is. 
                                As a result, we decided that the key features of our app would be a beer “diary” which users could use to log and rate beer and a beer “finder” that would recommend users a beer based on their taste preferences, along with a map that would help them locate the beer near them.<br>
                                To create the prototype we decided to first decide on a colour scheme that would suit the use of the app. We used a swatching site to find a scheme that used amber colours, 
                                as that is a popular type of ail. <br>
                                Because we wanted an app that would draw new users in, we decided that we wanted to have some features that would be available to use without 
                                signing up for the app to get users interested in the app from the first use and without giving them too many tasks upfront. 
                                Thus, we decided that the landing page of the app should be the craft beer locator, with the beer “diary” coming after.<br>       
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Testing & Reiteration</h2>
                            <p>From our user testing, we learned that first, our colour scheme did not resonate with our users. Second, we learned that the app’s opening interaction would need to be changed so that it would better suit users.<br>
                                In the end, our final prototype would have users land on the map before having to sign into the app. If the user wanted, we allowed them to sign in for more personalized beer options. 
                                We also opted for a more muted colour theme, that built off of the golden yellow. <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>In conclusion, we learned a lot from this experience. Craft beer lovers are becoming a large community and will need a way to connect to one another. It would be amazing to connect craft beer communities world wide.<br>
