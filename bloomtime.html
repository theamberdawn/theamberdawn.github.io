                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>Due to Covid, keeping in touch with one's colleagues can be a challenge. Bloom Time was created to help connect and motivate employees. <br>
                                We decided to create an app that would allow coworkers to know what their coworkers are doing without having to disturb them. 
                                Additionally, working from home can be just as stressful as working from the office, and adding the pandemic into the mix, it's easy to see how one might become stressed. 
                                Thus, we decided to add a gamified aspect of caring for a plant to promote relaxation. <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Research & Empathy</h2>
                            <p>To research for this project, we each decided to find someone who is working from home and sit down and interview them.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                            <p>After collecting the data from the interviews, we set to work on creating an affinity diagram<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Ideation & Prototype</h2>
                            <p>When brainstorming ideas, we first had a large number of issues that we wanted to try and tackle. At first, we wanted to create a solution to as many problems as we could identify.<br>    
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Testing & Reiteration</h2>
                            <p>From our user testing we decided to reiterate on the landing page<br> </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>BloomTime has the potential to really unify a team that is physically distant from one another.<br>
                            </p>
