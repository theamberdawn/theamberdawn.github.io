                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>The ROM’s website is highly accessible, but lacking in overall style. For this project, I used cues from its current style to create something fresh and new. <br>
                                The University of Toronto UX/UI’s next solo project allowed students to choose a government agency and redesign their website. 
                                The ROM is known as one of Canada’s cultural centers, and deserves a site that creates the same excitement a visit to the museum does. We were given about two weeks to complete this assignment. <br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Research & Empathy</h2>
                            <p>As I had a friend who volunteers for the ROM, I started by consulting her to create a proto persona. I asked her about the most common client that she sees visiting the ROM. 
                                She stated that due to Toronto’s diverse history, many different kinds of people frequent the ROM. 
                                However, she did note that the ROM has always prided itself on its family inclusive activities, and that a lot of families came to enjoy the ROM. Using this knowledge, I created the proto persona to match. <br>
                                I decided to conduct user research centered around using the current site, along with including questions about how the ROM makes a person feel when they think about their visit. 
                                My research plan focused on finding out from participants what issues they have while planning a trip, what about the ROM that inspires them and lastly, having them utilize the current site to see if it currently meets their preferences that they stated earlier.<br>
                                Next, I focused on conducting a heuristic evaluation of their current site. Because accessibility is a key feature of any government website, I started by checking to make sure that it passed accessibility tests. 
                                As the colour scheme currently consisted of black, white and purple, it passed with flying colours. 
                                I also made note of all the pages and their headings, as one of the notes from my interviews mentioned that they like find information as quickly as possible.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Definition & Synthesis</h2>
                            <p>After conducting my research, I sat down to draw conclusions. I used an affinity diagram to clearly layout the different opinions. 
                                By grouping the various points that came out of the interviews, I noticed a lot of users noted that they value efficiency and easily accessible information. 
                                Using each point from the interviews as individual notes, I laid them out on a feature prioritization matrix to see which ideas would be best to implement.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Ideation & Prototype</h2>
                            <p>Before working on the prototype, I decided to first make sure that the site’s navigation was optimal. I decided to use card sorting, asking participants from the survey to sort the titles of the pages 
                                as they believed would be suitable. I decided to allow for an organic sort, taking all the titles of the webpages and gave them to the participants to sort in any order they choose. After they finished sorting, 
                                I inquired as to their thought process for sorting. With new categories in mind, I started on creating the wireframes for the site.<br>
                                After finishing the wireframes, I wanted to confirm that the new sitemap would indeed meet users’ criteria, and thus conducted tests using the wireframe.<br>
                                Once I was assured that I had reiterated on the wireframes, I set to work on creating the prototype.<br>
                                To inspire the design of the site, I looked at the ROM itself as a source. The building itself combines a historic building with a modern extension. <br>
                                I also looked at websites for similar types of attractions, both in Canada and around the world. I found the Louvre’s website to be a place of inspiration. <br>
                                I also found inspiration from ROM’s current site, as it uses purple heavily, which is considered to be a “royal” colour. I also found that its minimal colour palette helped with not only a 
                                more modern flare, but also the site accessibility.<br>
                                Using the information that I defined from my interviews, I created a prototype that I found to use exciting imagery while also maintaining the accessibility. <br>    
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Testing & Reiteration</h2>
                            <p>From the testing I learned just how important site architecture is for a site, and how to best optimize the user experience so that users are able to find what they need quickly.<br>
                                I made sure to implement the card sorting results that I gained from my users, and reiterated on them a few times until the users in the test had good things to say about the changes.<br>
                            </p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>Because the ROM is a premiere destination for visitors of Toronto, I believe that it is important that the site reflect its status as a Canadian symbol. 
                                I believe that the ROM’s site has a solid foundation. With some creative enhancements, I believe that they could have a site that rivals that of museums world wide.<br>
